Here are some extra points you can add to your README file to make it more detailed and informative:

 🔥 Secure Authentication & Authorization System

This project is a simple one to how works jwt built using Spring Boot (Backend) and React (Frontend). It leverages JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure access control and role-based authentication.



🚀 Features

✅ User Authentication
   - Secure login & registration using JWT.
   - Password hashing with "BCrypt".

✅ Role-Based Authorization
   - Supports multiple user roles (e.g., "Admin,User").
   - Restricted access to certain routes based on user roles.

✅ JWT Token Management
   - Token generation on login.
   - Token validation and expiration handling.

✅ Spring Boot Backend
   - Built with "Spring Security" for authentication.
   - Uses "Spring Boot, Hibernate, and JPA" for database management.
   - CORS and CSRF protection for enhanced security.

✅ "React Frontend"
   - "React Router" for protected routes.
   - TailwindCSS for modern UI styling.
   - API integration with Axios.

 

✅ **Database Integration**
   - Uses MySQL Workbench as the database.
   - Implements entity relationships using JPA.

✅ Security Enhancements
   - CSRF Protection, CORS Policy, and Secure Headers.
   - Environment variables for sensitive data.
   - CSRF is disabled bz jwt implement as stateless
